At each class meeting one or more students (depending on class size) will be responsible for preparing a brief (10-minute maximum) presentation on the readings, consisting of a background that will frame our discussion with one or more (one question per student) about how the readings assigned for that particular day approach the main questions at the core of our class. The students’ questions will be e-mailed in advance to the instructors by 8PM the evening before the corresponding class. At the end of each class and time permitting, the same student(s) who did the opening presentation will give a very short (two minute) synopsis/synthesis of the class discussion, highlighting whether and how it addressed the questions raised at the beginning of that day’s session. You will be given guidance on how to prepare these presentations.

You will be required to write 3 essays this semester and 1 revision essay, which will be equivalent to a fourth essay. All essays will necessitate close reading of texts — with, in some cases, special attention to language related issues.
